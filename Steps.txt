Steps:

1. Checked Null values, no null value is present.

2. Label encoded object data type

3. Dropped all the columns having 0 variance.

4. Splitted data into 80% train set and 20% test set.

5. Standardized data.

6. Trained the model using xgboost.

7. Predicted the data for test set.

Experiment:
Tried applying PCA after standardized the data, but that significantly dropped the R-squared value even after choosing the efficient n_componenets for PCA.
